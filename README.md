# Vigenere_Cipher

A program to encipher and decipher text using Vigenere's cipher method I wrote this fun program because we were discussing Vigenere's cipher method in my cryptology course. We learned that this method was efficient at beating letter frequency statistics and was widely belived to be secure for its time, but becasue of the rise of computers this method is very easy to decipher.**
